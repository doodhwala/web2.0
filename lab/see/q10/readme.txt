Early send
    Send as soon as the user types. Super quick response but server overloaded with reqs and this might result in slowing down of the client side as well.

Late send
    Wait for the user to stop typing and send after a small delay. The user should not notice those few millisecond of difference. Better for server and somewhat better for the user.
