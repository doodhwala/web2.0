The next lab exercise for the semester - LAB 6

This one is on reverse AJAX.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
-----------------------------

Implement the CHAT application with two chat windows (one for each party).
There should be two chat windows.

Use the "Server Sent Events" Technology to accomplish the task.

Hints/Tips:
--------------------------

1. Use ev = EventSource("server.php"); to trigger a SSE connection from client side.

2. Use ev.addEventListener() to register for the event.

3. In the handler function read event.data to get the server sent message.
   (See class room example for more details or refer notes)
   
4. From the server side, set content-type to "text/event-stream".

5. Fire events from the server side whenever it is ready using event/data property pairs.
   That is, if the server wants to send a string called "hello" through an event
   named "myevent",
   
   then:
   
   echo "event:myevent\n";
   echo "data: hello\n\n";
   
   ( Don't forget the double newline in the last "data" line.
   
6. To make life simpler, let the two parties invoke different server scripts
   and also write to different files (in practical cases they will actually
   launch the same server script and write to the same file as well).
   
7. When you have different files to monitor, you can just cut/paste code 
   and use it for either party.
   
8. Also, use separate browser WINDOWS for the two parties. The same window means 
   the same JS DOM and can cause a lot of confusion while coding.
   
   Good Luck :)
